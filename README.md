# Spine Study Group

This is a temporary project (during March 2025?) to host the files for the spine study group (in the context of the Mopo project in preparation for WP5). The spine study group is a playground to experiment with spinetools (with a focus on SpineOpt). There will not necessarily be a big end goal or structure.

Some of the topics that will be addressed:
+ the existing spineopt tutorials
+ making new 

warning: the links in this readme file are here to help you. However, there is always a risk with clicking on links. So, always check a link before you click on it.

## Join
To join the study group, send a mail to tars.verschelde@kuleuven.be . If you are part of the Mopo project, I'll add you as soon as possible to the Teams meeting and as a developer on github. If you are not of the Mopo project, I guess you are still welcome but you will have to provide a small motivation and you'll have to accept that Mopo project members are prioritised (especially during the online meetings). We'll just have to see what works and what not.

We can also use the spinetools community gitter chat to help each other out during the week.

## Approach
Initially we simply go through the existing tutorials one by one. Each tutorial is given as homework first and then the issues and solutions are given during the session. It is ok if you fail the homework but it is important that you at least try because spine tools is something you can only learn if you actually try to use it.

Once warmed up, we'll venture into the dark and try to make some setups ourselves. You can steer these new exercises in the direction that may be useful to you, so be sure to participate ;)

## Prerequisites
For this study group we will obviously use spine tools.

### Gitter
We will communicate through gitter as this is also used in WP4. Once you click on the button you are invited to the room but you actually still need an application to get it running. There will be some guidance but you might need some extra help.

Gitter has moved to [matrix](https://matrix.org/) so you need an application that runs matrix. [Element](https://element.io/) is a very solid option but there are other cute ones like [Fluffy chat](https://fluffychat.im/).

Matrix allows for different server domains. By default it selects Matrix.org but in this case we actually want gitter.im so make sure to change to that.

Finally you can make your account with a github account.

If the room is not automatically added, you can just click the gitter button above again.

Note that Matrix is a more secure application and from time to time will ask for verification. Suppose that you change your application from element to fluffychat. It is recommended that you first install and setup fluffychat before you remove element as you might require the old application to verify the new application. Perhaps it is not a problem for public rooms but it might be for your personal chats.

### Learning material
Feel free to add some learning material here.

## Planning
The meetings are scheduled to be held every tuesday from 15:00 to 16:00 (GMT) in Teams (except for each 1st tuesday of the month). The meetings will mostly be used to share our experiences. The agenda is a guideline; additional topics are certainly welcome. Further discussions are also possible in the gitter rooms.
